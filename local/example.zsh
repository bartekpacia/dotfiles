# This directory is for machine-specific files that need to be sources
# during shell startup by ~/.zshrc.

# All files in this directory will be automatically sourced by ~/.zshrc.

# Also, all files in this dir (except this one, of course) are ignored
# by git.

# This very file is here only to demostrate the purpose of this directory
# Uncomment to see that it works
